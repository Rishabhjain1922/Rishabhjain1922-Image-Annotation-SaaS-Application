Image Annotation SaaS Application
This is a full-stack web application for medical image annotation, built using ReactJS for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It provides tools for healthcare professionals to annotate medical images by adding shapes (such as circles and ellipses), measuring distances, calculating angles, and identifying geometric shapes. The application aims to enhance diagnosis and treatment planning in healthcare.

Features
Image Annotation: Annotate regions of interest in medical images with various shapes such as circles, ellipses, and freeform annotations.
Angle Calculations: Calculate angles between points on the image for more precise measurements.
Shape Detection: Identify and mark geometric shapes within images.
Performance Optimized: Fast and responsive UI with a smooth experience for users.
User-friendly Interface: Clean and easy-to-navigate design for lab technicians and medical professionals.
Tech Stack
Frontend: ReactJS
Backend: Spring Boot
Styling: CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)
Database: (Optional, depending on your future needs)
Image Formats Supported: PNG, JPEG, and others (customizable)

Setup and Installation
1. Frontend Setup (ReactJS)
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend

Install the required dependencies:
npm install
Start the React development server:
npm start
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

2. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend
Install the required dependencies:

If you're using Maven:
mvn install
Or if you're using Gradle:
gradle build
Run the Spring Boot application:
mvn spring-boot:run
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:8080.

3. Build and Serve React with Spring Boot (Optional for Production)
To deploy the application together:
Build the React application:
npm run build
Copy the contents of the build folder to the src/main/resources/static/ folder in the Spring Boot project.

Run the Spring Boot application:
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will be available at http://localhost:8080, serving both the React frontend and Spring Boot API.

Usage
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
Upload a medical image in PNG or JPEG format.
Use the annotation tools to add shapes, measure distances, and calculate angles.
Save and export your annotations for further use or share them with other medical professionals.
Future Improvements
Support for additional image formats (e.g., DICOM for medical imaging).
User authentication and role-based access for lab technicians and medical professionals.
Integration with databases for storing annotations and image data.
Enhanced shape recognition and AI-assisted annotations for faster results.
